# First Principles Framework - Detailed Methodology

## The Elon Musk Method (Physics Thinking)

"Boil things down to the most fundamental truths and then reason up from there."

### The Battery Example
- **Conventional**: "Batteries are expensive ($600/kWh), always have been"
- **First Principles**: What are batteries made of? Carbon, nickel, aluminum, polymers
- **Atomic Question**: What do those materials cost on the London Metal Exchange?
- **Discovery**: Raw materials = $80/kWh
- **Rebuild**: Engineer better manufacturing → Tesla's cost breakthrough

## The Decomposition Ladder

### Level 1: Surface Problem
"We need better parent engagement"

### Level 2: Functional Need
"Parents need to feel connected to their child's day"

### Level 3: Emotional Core
"Parents feel guilt about not being present"

### Level 4: Fundamental Truth
"Humans need proof of wellbeing for those they love"

### Level 5: Atomic Solution
Photo + timestamp + child's face = proof of wellbeing
Everything else is decoration.

## Common Assumption Traps

### The "Industry Standard" Trap
"Everyone does it this way" → WHY does everyone do it this way?
Often: legacy, not logic

### The "Customer Said" Trap
"Customers asked for X" → What PROBLEM were they trying to solve?
Often: they're describing solutions, not needs

### The "Technology Exists" Trap
"We should use [tech] because it exists" → What fundamental need does this serve?
Often: solution seeking a problem

### The "Competitor Does It" Trap
"Competitor has this feature" → Does it actually solve a real problem?
Often: feature bloat, not value

## Questions That Cut Through

1. "If we were starting from scratch today, would we build it this way?"
2. "What would a complete outsider think is weird about this?"
3. "If this cost 10x more, would we still do it?"
4. "If this was illegal, what would we do instead?"
5. "What's the version of this that a child could understand?"

## Integration with Other Skills

- Use **Inversion** to validate: "How would this fundamental solution fail?"
- Use **Second-Order Consequences** to project: "What happens after we implement this?"
- Use **Pre-Mortem** before building: "Imagine this failed. Why?"
